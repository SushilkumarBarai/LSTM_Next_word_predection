# Next-Word Prediction Using LSTM

This project demonstrates the implementation of a next-word prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to create a model that can predict the next word in a sentence, which can be useful in various natural language processing tasks like text generation, autocomplete suggestions, and more.
